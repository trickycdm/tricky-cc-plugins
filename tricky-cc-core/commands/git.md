I have just finished one or more features. It's time to commit to Git and to update the documentation.

Examine the changes using Git commands and if you do not have context already look at the changed files to create me an suitable git commit message and if it was backend changes, decide if documentation for that feature needs created or updated using our documentation-generator subagent.

Wait for documentation sub agent to complete before the final git commit. No not push the changes, we only want the commit.

After making your changes, briefly list the commits made, and link to any documentation files that got updated.
