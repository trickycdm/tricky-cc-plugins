description: Create a copy pasteable summary of the current session designed to allow you to /clear and bootstrap a new session with all the relevant context.

I would like to reset the Claude Code session, but I don't want to have to set all the relevant context on what we just done, and describe whatever is relevant. Collate a detailed overview of all the work carried out, file links and any details that will be useful for the LLM when starting a new session. Once you have this information construct it into a prompt which could full initialize a new session, explaining the context that we have just finished a session and want to pick up where we left off. Output this in a format I can just copy paste into a new session.
