# Merge Worktree

Squash-merge the PR for a worktree branch, clean up the worktree and branch, update main, and report what's left.

Announce at start: "Merging worktree — gathering context."

## Step 0: Gather Context

Run all of these (they're independent — run in parallel where possible):

```
pwd
git branch --show-current
git worktree list
git status --porcelain
git rev-list @{u}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo NO_UPSTREAM
gh pr view --json number,url,state,title,headRefName 2>&1 || echo NO_PR
```

## Step 1: Determine Target

From the context above, extract these variables:

| Variable | How to find it |
|---|---|
| `{MAIN_WORKTREE}` | Path of the first entry in `git worktree list` (the one on `main`) |
| `{WORKTREE_PATH}` | Path of the feature worktree being merged |
| `{BRANCH}` | The feature worktree's branch name |
| `{NUMBER}` | PR number (from `gh pr view` or `gh pr list --head {BRANCH}`) |
| `{INVOKED_FROM}` | Either `"worktree"` or `"main"` — where the session is running |

**If current branch is `worktree-*` or not `main`** (inside a feature worktree):
- `{INVOKED_FROM}` = `"worktree"`
- `{WORKTREE_PATH}` = current directory
- `{BRANCH}` = current branch
- `{MAIN_WORKTREE}` = first entry from worktree list

**If current branch is `main`** (in the main worktree):
- `{INVOKED_FROM}` = `"main"`
- `{MAIN_WORKTREE}` = current directory
- List all non-main worktrees
- If exactly one exists: target it automatically
- If multiple exist: show the list and ask the user which one to merge (use AskUserQuestion)
- If none exist: STOP — "No feature worktrees found."
- Set `{WORKTREE_PATH}` and `{BRANCH}` from the chosen worktree
- Get the PR: `gh pr list --head {BRANCH} --json number,url,state,title --jq '.[0]'`

## Step 2: Precondition Checks

Only two checks before proceeding — everything else fails naturally with clear errors from `gh pr merge`.

| Check | Detect | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Uncommitted changes in target worktree | `git -C {WORKTREE_PATH} status --porcelain` is non-empty | STOP — tell user to commit or stash |
| Unpushed commits | rev-list shows commit SHAs or NO_UPSTREAM | Run `git -C {WORKTREE_PATH} push -u origin HEAD`, then continue |

After pushing (if needed), ensure a PR exists:
- If no PR: create one with `gh pr create --head {BRANCH} --base main --fill`
- Re-fetch the PR number after creation

If any of these fail, STOP and show the error.

## Step 3: Merge the PR

```
gh pr merge {NUMBER} --squash
```

Do NOT use `--delete-branch` — it tries to switch branches locally, which fails when `main` is already checked out in the main worktree. Branch cleanup is handled in Step 4.

If this fails, STOP and show the error. Common causes: failing CI checks, merge conflicts, missing approvals. Show the PR URL so the user can investigate.

## Step 4: Cleanup + Update Main

**CRITICAL**: This MUST be a single Bash invocation. After `worktree remove` deletes `{WORKTREE_PATH}`, the shell's CWD no longer exists (if invoked from the worktree) and ALL subsequent Bash calls will fail. Every command uses `git -C {MAIN_WORKTREE}` to operate from the main worktree regardless of shell CWD state.

Do NOT split these into separate Bash calls. Do NOT remove or reorder commands.

```bash
git -C {MAIN_WORKTREE} worktree remove --force {WORKTREE_PATH}; git -C {MAIN_WORKTREE} worktree prune; git -C {MAIN_WORKTREE} branch -D {BRANCH} 2>/dev/null; git -C {MAIN_WORKTREE} fetch --prune && git -C {MAIN_WORKTREE} pull --ff-only; echo "===REMAINING WORKTREES==="; git -C {MAIN_WORKTREE} worktree list
```

Commands joined with `;` (continue regardless of errors) except `fetch && pull` which are dependent. Individual failures are tolerated — the branch or worktree directory may already be gone.

## Step 5: Report

Parse the output from Step 4. Everything after `===REMAINING WORKTREES===` is the current worktree list.

Summarize:
- PR was squash-merged (include title and URL from context)
- Worktree was removed
- Main branch was updated (or note if ff-only failed, based on Step 4 output)
- List remaining worktrees from Step 4 output

**If `{INVOKED_FROM}` = `"worktree"`**: End with:
> "The working directory has been deleted. Please close this session and open a new one from the main worktree."

Do NOT run any further Bash commands — the shell is broken because the CWD was deleted.

**If `{INVOKED_FROM}` = `"main"`**: No special warning needed. The shell is fine.

## Safety Rules

**Never:**
- Remove a worktree without merging its PR first
- Delete worktrees the user didn't confirm (when multiple exist)
- Split Step 4 into multiple Bash calls
- Run Bash commands after Step 4 completes when `{INVOKED_FROM}` = `"worktree"`
- Use `--delete-branch` with `gh pr merge`

**Always:**
- Use `git -C {MAIN_WORKTREE}` for all git commands in Steps 4+
- Keep all post-merge operations in a single Bash invocation
- Tolerate errors during cleanup (worktree remove, branch delete may partially succeed)
- Confirm with the user before merging if the target is ambiguous
